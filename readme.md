# `digester.py`: Paper digest powered by claude

- Get your anthropic api key, store in `.env` file as `CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
  - you need to set up a payment method for API access
- Run `demo.ipynb` with `paper_url` of your choice.
  - this is deliberately a notebook because (1) claude is expensive - don't burn through your credits, and (2) you can see the output rendered in markdown
